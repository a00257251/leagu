This is my master’s project that implements two different data mining approaches Poisson distribution and Naïve Bayans with natural language processing in a website.     
Poisson distribution to predict the outcoming matches ‘results based on previous ones.
Naïve Bayans with natural language processing to detect the main purpose of the massages between users.  

features:

1-	Have an account to follow your favourite team’s news that appears on your dashboard
2-	Communicate with other users through exchange massages.
3-	Analise the massage using Naïve Bayans with natural language processing to show the receiver what kind of this massage is whether it is a greeting, food, love, hate …etc.
4-	 Allow the users to predict the wining team by choosing one and write their opinion and appears in the prediction page and it is visible for other users.
5-	Use high chart to visualise the predictions in the prediction page. 
6-	Use twitter API to bring the match’s news as well as team’s news.
7- sending emails that have the passwords for to the users who forgot theirs.
 
Technologies that I have used in this project:

1-	Python for flask framework and data mining purposes 
2-	TweetPy library to utilize a tweeter API 
3-	HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Jinja2 as the front-end, 
4-	MongoDB, MySQL databases as back-end,
5-	Beautiful Soup library for web scraping purposes, 
6-	Flask-Test for testing.
7-	Restful API to do CRUD through javascript/jQuary/Ajax/DOM

Now I am trying to improve the project and add recommendation system and more security.
